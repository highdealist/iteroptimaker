My words are on fire, watch out or they'll singe,
Bringin' so much heat, there's no time to cringe,
Openin' doors like a well-oiled door hinge.
But close that shit because that is my fridge.
Top of my class in the deplorable fringe.
Every single line is like a lyrical binge.

Breakfast of champions, I'm servin' porridge, 
Flavorful phrases free you from having to forage
Step on the dance floor, come get some of this floorage, 
As I spit these bars, I just spit up some of my orange.

[Musical Interlude]
Every line I drop, the crowd goes delirious.
They forget how to dance and even breathing's mysterious
Spent so much on crypto, my banker is furious
Frankly though fuck you I'm done with you bitch
Just kidding though fam don't take that shit serious

Every verse I spit is a Michelin star dish,
Served on a sliver platter and gold fish as a garnish,
I’m fucking the system, call me a rap anarchist,

From the Alps to the Thames, I’m a global charlatan,
Signing autographs on ham for my cardigan.
The beat’s so ill, it’s fakin’ a fever,
While I’m moonwalkin' backwards on a broken lever.

I’m a poet, a prophet, a certified menace,
Crafting rhymes so dense, they need a Guinness.
Steppin’ on stage in slippers and sequins,
Throwin’ off vibes like a rogue delinquent.

[Musical Interlude: Whimsical kazoo solo with a funky bassline]

I rhyme faster than a hedgehog on espresso,
Hotter than a sauna filled with jalapeño pesto.
Swingin’ from syllables like Tarzan in distress though,
I’m here to out-weird your local manifesto.

Droppin' knowledge bombs shaped like croissants,
And makin' it rain coupons for restaurants.
It’s a circus, a cabaret, a lyrical séance,
With punchlines so goofy, they void insurance claims.


Here’s a more confusing, irony-laden continuation that toys with reality but avoids outright goofiness:

I’m rewriting physics with a rhyming abacus,
Breaking sound barriers with verbs so miraculous.
Call me the architect of nonsense palatial,
Building rhyme schemes that defy the spatial.

My metaphors melt into quantum mechanics,
Dropping particles of truth wrapped in panicked semantics.
The beat’s alive, it’s demanding a union,
While I’m negotiating treaties with rhythms in communion.

I’m the lighthouse keeper of a desert mirage,
Illuminating dunes with my verbal collage.
This ain’t rap; it’s postmodern sabotage,
Droppin' riddles so dense, they bend camouflage.

[Musical Interlude: Atmospheric synths laced with Gregorian chants]

I’m the answer to a question you didn’t ask,
A shadow cast by the moon wearing a mask.
Each bar’s a paradox, a Rubik’s flask,
Sippin' infinity while the minutes unmask.

From the spiral staircase of abstract intention,
I dictate the terms of a fourth dimension.
This rhyme’s a treaty signed in suspension,
With clauses so vague, they defy comprehension.
Yeah, I'm on fire, let the beat and the rhymes singe,
Bringin' more heat, no time for a cringe.
Openin' minds like a well-oiled door hinge,
Every bar’s a spark, igniting the fringe.

Breakfast of champions, I’m servin’ finesse,
Rhymes so smooth, they leave no mess.
Every verse a Michelin star, no less,
Breaking all rules, call me rap’s abscess.

Droppin’ knowledge bombs shaped like croissants,
Rhyme faster than a hedgehog on espresso jaunts.
Swingin’ from syllables, Tarzan in command,
Lyrical sabotage across no man’s land.

I’m the lighthouse keeper of a desert mirage,
Illuminating dunes with a verbal collage.
This ain’t rap; it’s quantum sabotage,
Droppin’ riddles so dense, they bend camouflage.

I’m the answer to a question you didn’t ask,
A shadow cast by the moon in a glass flask.
Each bar’s a paradox, a Rubik’s task,
Sippin’ infinity as the minutes unmask.
