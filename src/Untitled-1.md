[Intro]
G D Em C
Lyrics:
Transform me now
C G D Em
Into who I'm meant to be
C G D

[Verse 1]
I've been playing it safe
But my heart longs for more
So I'll take that chance
And walk out that door

[Chorus]
Transform me now
Into who I'm meant to be
No holding back anymore
I'm letting my spirit soar
Free at last, mine's the key

[Verse 2]
Held down for far too long
Just waiting, not growing strong
Now I see what I must face
The power of this new phase

[Chorus]
Transform me now
Into who I'm meant to be
No holding back anymore
I'm letting my spirit soar
Free at last, mine's the key

[Bridge]
It's a brand new day
A whole new me and way
So I'll go with the flow
Embracing all life bestows

[Chorus]
Transform me now
Into who I'm meant to be
No holding back anymore
Remember what you are here for
If you have no idea, then you must explore
Free at last, mine's the key

[Outro]
